Compile using gcc
run using ./a.out
Make sure Assignment1.c, Data1.txt, and Out1.txt are all located on the same local drive

When editing Data1.txt to change the ouput make sure there is a space between each number in list
Also make sure there is no space at the end or this will cause an empty spot in array. You
will be able to see this as a random 0.0 in the output
